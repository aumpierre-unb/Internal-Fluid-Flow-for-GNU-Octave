======================================
* All functions' help-comments reviewed e fixed
* Minor modifications on README.md, INDEX and DESCRIPTION
* LICENSE included (redundant with COPYING)
* Icon image file replaced by vector file
* Function f2Re computes friction factor 
  for laminar regime and/or turbulent regime
* Relative roughness has a default value 
  for both f2Re and Re2f functions 
  (for cases where laminar flow is the target), 
  instead of being a mandatory input
* Plots include a fully rough regime line
* Relative roughnesse assigned to rr on m-files, 
  instead of eps
