======================================
* Minor adjustments on plots


internal-fluid-flow 0.1.0 (2022-08-20)
======================================
* Spell fixed for "Colebrook"
* Adoption of semantic versioning (https://semver.org)
* Laminar/turbulent transition reset from 3e3 to 2.3e3
* Axes' titles adapted to fit to functions' inputs
* Minor corrections on help comments
* Major changes on code to solve bug on the transitional region


internal-fluid-flow 0.0.3 (2022-07-23)
======================================
* Spell correction: "Weissbach" replaced by by "Weisbach"
  in DESCRIPTION and README.md
* Line 22 of f2Re: default set to eps=2e-3e
* Line 58 of f2Re: second condition removed
* Line 45 of Re2f: "Re<2500" replaced by "Re<3e3" 


internal-fluid-flow 0.0.2 (2022-07-14)
======================================
* All functions' help-comments reviewed e fixed
* Minor modifications on README.md, INDEX and DESCRIPTION
* LICENSE included (however redundant with COPYING)
* Icon image file replaced by vector file
* Function f2Re computes friction factor 
  for laminar regime and/or turbulent regime, 
  accordingly
* A default value is set to former mandatory inpput 
  relative roughness for both f2Re and Re2f functions 
  (for cases where laminar flow is the target)
* Plots include a fully rough regime line 
  for the sake of reference
  

internal-fluid-flow 0.0.1 (2022-07-05)
